# UN Duty Station Codes React Application

A modern React TypeScript application for managing UN duty station codes with enhanced search, mapping, and request management functionality.

## üéØ Project Overview

This is a complete rebuild of the existing UN Duty Station Codes application using modern React, TypeScript, and Vite. The application provides an intuitive interface for searching duty stations and submitting requests for new, updated, or removed duty station codes to the UN CEB team.

- **Geocoding Service**: Address to coordinates conversion
- **Multiple Tile Layers**: OpenStreetMap and satellite view options

### Complete Request Management

- **Update Requests**: Modify existing station information
- **Remove Requests**: Proper removal workflow with justification
- **Form Persistence**: Manual save/load functionality for draft requests

### Enhanced Basket Management
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Modern @dnd-kit implementation for request prioritization
- **Advanced Validation Engine**: Comprehensive scoring system with detailed feedback
- **Multi-step Submission Flow**: Prepare ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Submit workflow
- **Request History Tracking**: Submission history with restore capabilities

## üìä Data Sources

The application successfully fetches data directly from the UN CEB public repository:

- **Duty Stations**: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CEB-HLCM/HR-Public-Codes/refs/heads/main/DSCITYCD.csv (‚úÖ 4,295 stations loaded)
- **Countries**: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CEB-HLCM/HR-Public-Codes/refs/heads/main/DSCTRYCD.csv (‚úÖ 222 countries loaded)

**‚úÖ Data Loading Successfully** - GitHub raw URLs work perfectly with simple `fetch(url)` calls. **Critical lesson learned**: Avoid custom headers which trigger CORS preflight requests. Data is loaded fresh on each session with proper caching for performance.
