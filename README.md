## 📊 Data Sources

The application successfully fetches data directly from the UN CEB public repository:

- **Duty Stations**: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CEB-HLCM/HR-Public-Codes/refs/heads/main/DSCITYCD.csv (✅ 4,295 stations loaded)
- **Countries**: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CEB-HLCM/HR-Public-Codes/refs/heads/main/DSCTRYCD.csv (✅ 222 countries loaded)

**✅ Data Loading Successfully** - GitHub raw URLs work perfectly with simple `fetch(url)` calls. **Critical lesson learned**: Avoid custom headers which trigger CORS preflight requests. Data is loaded fresh on each session with proper caching for performance.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd new-duty-station-database
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production (includes TypeScript check + Vite build)
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Production Deployment

The application is deployed to Netlify with automated builds from the main branch:

**Build Configuration:**
- Node version: 20 (specified in `.nvmrc`)
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- Automatic deploys: Enabled on push to main

**Deployment Files:**
- `netlify.toml` - Build settings, security headers, redirects
- `.nvmrc` - Node version specification
- `public/_redirects` - SPA routing configuration
- `fix-build.js` - Post-build validation script

## 🔧 Configuration

### EmailJS Integration
The application uses EmailJS for submitting requests to the UN CEB team. Configuration uses secure environment variables in `.env.local`:

```env
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
```

**Setup Instructions:**

1. **Create EmailJS Account**: Sign up at [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. **Create Email Service**: Add your email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. **Create Email Template**: Use the template ID from your EmailJS dashboard
4. **Get Public Key**: Find your public key in EmailJS account settings
5. **Set Environment Variables**: Create `.env.local` in project root with the values above

**Note**: The application will work in simulation mode if EmailJS is not configured. Requests will be saved to history but no actual emails will be sent. The UI will display a warning when EmailJS is not configured.

## 🎨 Design System

The application maintains visual consistency with the original UN Duty Station Codes app:

- **Primary Blue**: #008fd5 (UN branding color)
- **Table Headers**: #96C8DA
- **Material-UI Theme**: Custom theme matching original branding
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint optimization

## 🧪 Code Quality

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency enforcement
- **Zero Console Errors**: Clean development environment
- **Material-UI Best Practices**: Proper theming and component usage
- **React Hook Form**: Controlled component patterns with validation (planned)

## 📝 Critical Development Notes

1. **TypeScript verbatimModuleSyntax**: Use `import type` for interfaces and `import` for values
2. **Material-UI v7 Grid Syntax**: MUST use `size={{ xs: 12 }}` format (breaking change from v6)
3. **HTML Nesting Prevention**: Follow Material-UI component hierarchy guidelines
4. **Performance**: Debounced search (300ms), optimized rendering, marker clustering for maps
5. **Data Integrity**: Direct GitHub CSV fetching, fresh data loading, no persistent caching
6. **Form Stability**: Manual save/load system, no auto-save infinite loops (planned)
7. **Simplified Architecture**: No proxy configurations or complex CORS workarounds needed
8. **Custom Type Declarations**: Some packages (e.g., `soundex`) don't have `@types` packages - use custom `.d.ts` files
9. **Deployment**: Always test `npm run build` locally before pushing to production

## 🤝 Contributing

This project follows strict development standards:
- All components must be TypeScript-typed
- Zero tolerance for console errors/warnings

## 🚀 Deployment Success

The application successfully deployed to Netlify after resolving 50+ TypeScript compilation errors. Key lessons learned:
- Material-UI v7 Grid syntax requires `size={{ xs: 12 }}` format
- Custom type declarations needed for packages without `@types` (e.g., `soundex`)
- Production TypeScript config is stricter than development mode
- Always test `npm run build` locally before pushing
