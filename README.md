## 📊 Data Sources

The application successfully fetches data directly from the UN CEB public repository:

- **Duty Stations**: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CEB-HLCM/HR-Public-Codes/refs/heads/main/DSCITYCD.csv (✅ 4,295 stations loaded)
- **Countries**: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CEB-HLCM/HR-Public-Codes/refs/heads/main/DSCTRYCD.csv (✅ 222 countries loaded)

**✅ Data Loading Successfully** - GitHub raw URLs work perfectly with simple `fetch(url)` calls. **Critical lesson learned**: Avoid custom headers which trigger CORS preflight requests. Data is loaded fresh on each session with proper caching for performance.

## 🎨 Design System

The application maintains visual consistency with the original UN Duty Station Codes app:

- **Primary Blue**: #008fd5 (UN branding color)
- **Table Headers**: #96C8DA
- **Material-UI Theme**: Custom theme matching original branding
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint optimization

## 🧪 Code Quality

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency enforcement
- **Zero Console Errors**: Clean development environment
- **Material-UI Best Practices**: Proper theming and component usage
- **React Hook Form**: Controlled component patterns with validation (planned)

## 📝 Critical Development Notes

1. **TypeScript verbatimModuleSyntax**: Use `import type` for interfaces and `import` for values
2. **Material-UI v7 Grid Syntax**: MUST use `size={{ xs: 12 }}` format (breaking change from v6)
3. **HTML Nesting Prevention**: Follow Material-UI component hierarchy guidelines
4. **Performance**: Debounced search (300ms), optimized rendering, marker clustering for maps
5. **Data Integrity**: Direct GitHub CSV fetching, fresh data loading, no persistent caching
6. **Form Stability**: Manual save/load system, no auto-save infinite loops (planned)
7. **Simplified Architecture**: No proxy configurations or complex CORS workarounds needed
8. **Custom Type Declarations**: Some packages (e.g., `soundex`) don't have `@types` packages - use custom `.d.ts` files
9. **Deployment**: Always test `npm run build` locally before pushing to production

## 🤝 Contributing

This project follows strict development standards:
- All components must be TypeScript-typed
- Zero tolerance for console errors/warnings

**Last Updated**: October 7, 2025  
**Production URL**: Deployed on Netlify with automated builds

## 🎯 Ready for Phase 6 Development

Phases 1-5 are now **100% complete** and the application is **LIVE IN PRODUCTION**. The next development session should focus on **Phase 6 - Request Management System**:

1. **DutyStationRequestPage** with complete form validation
2. **Request basket system** with drag-and-drop (@dnd-kit)
3. **Form persistence** with localStorage
4. **Zod schema validation** for all forms
5. **Request history** and status tracking
6. **Batch submission** workflow

Use the **Phase 6 prompt** from `NEXT_PHASE_PROMPT.md` to continue development with complete context and clear objectives.

## 🚀 Deployment Success

The application successfully deployed to Netlify after resolving 50+ TypeScript compilation errors. Key lessons learned:
- Material-UI v7 Grid syntax requires `size={{ xs: 12 }}` format
- Custom type declarations needed for packages without `@types` (e.g., `soundex`)
- Production TypeScript config is stricter than development mode
- Always test `npm run build` locally before pushing
